Round Robin Tournament Pairing System

This module implements FIDE-compliant round-robin tournament pairings using
Berger tables. It supports tournaments with 3-16 players and handles both
even and odd numbers of players (with bye assignments for odd numbers).

The Berger tables ensure that:
- Each player plays every other player exactly once
- Color balance is maintained as much as possible
- Bye assignments follow FIDE rules (highest number gets bye)

Example:
    >>> from gambitpairing.player import Player
    >>> players = [Player("Alice"), Player("Bob"), Player("Charlie")]
    >>> rr = RoundRobin(players)
    >>> first_round = rr.get_round_pairings(1)
    >>> print(first_round)

# FIDE Berger Tables for Round-Robin Tournaments
#
# These tables define the pairing schedule for round-robin tournaments.
# Player numbers are 0-indexed (adjusted from FIDE's 1-indexed tables).
# For odd numbers of players, the highest index represents a bye.
#
# Format: Each tuple represents one round, containing tuples of (player1, player2)
